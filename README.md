# 📸 Fotos Baby Flask Application

## Overview / Описание
This repository contains a production-oriented Flask application for a baby and maternity photography studio. Static assets are processed with Flask-Assets, while Cloudflare Turnstile protects the public contact form.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Marketing pages** (home, pricing, portfolio, about, contact, privacy) rendered from Jinja templates.
- **Dynamic pricing and FAQ blocks** seeded from the database at start-up to keep content in sync with `config.pakets` and `config.qa_list`.
- **Client proofing area** that generates responsive galleries, supports HTMX-powered approval workflows, and exports ZIP archives of client photos.
- **Admin dashboard** for creating projects, uploading images, and resetting client passwords using Flask-Login and bcrypt hashing.
- **Email and CAPTCHA integration** for the contact form via Flask-Mail and Cloudflare Turnstile.
- **Automated portfolio gallery builder** that pre-renders responsive HTML fragments for each photography category.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Install prerequisites**
   - Python 3.12 (matches the Docker image) and pip.
   - SQLite (ships with Python on most platforms).
2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/Flask_Final.git
   cd Flask_Final
   ```
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Create the instance folder (if it does not exist)**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p instance
   ```

## 🔐 Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root before launching the app. The table below lists the most important variables referenced in the code base:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_KEY` | ✅ | Master secret used in `config.SECRET_KEY` to sign Flask sessions. Generate a long random string. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | Cloudflare Turnstile secret (server-side) used to verify CAPTCHA tokens. Despite the name collision with Flask, it is read directly via `os.getenv`. |
| `SITE_KEY` | ✅ | Cloudflare Turnstile public site key injected into the contact template. |
| `VERIFY_URL` | ✅ | Cloudflare Turnstile verification endpoint (e.g. `https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify`). |
| `IP` / `PORT` | ⬜️ | Host and port for local development when running `python app_route.py`. Defaults are not provided, so set `IP=127.0.0.1`, `PORT=5000` for development. |
| `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_SERVER`, `MAIL_PORT` | ⬜️ | Override the defaults in `config.py` if you deploy with a different SMTP provider. |

> **Note:** For production deployments rename either the Flask or Turnstile secret in the configuration to avoid ambiguity. The current code base expects both variables.

After creating the `.env` file, reload your shell or export the variables manually so that `python-dotenv` can pick them up.

## 🗃️ Database & Seed Data
- On the first launch the app creates `instance/fotos-baby.db` and initializes the schema defined in `Client`, `Preise`, and `Question`.
- Pricing bundles (`pakets`) and FAQ entries (`qa_list`) are synchronized from `config.py` into the database every time the app starts, ensuring changes in code propagate to production automatically.
- To add an admin user (e.g., `adminka`) or client projects, sign in via `/login/` after inserting the hashed credentials manually, or use the admin dashboard to create new projects once an initial admin account exists in the database.

## ▶️ Running the Application
### Development server
```bash
flask --app app_route run --debug
# or
python app_route.py
```
The development server compiles CSS bundles on demand (via Flask-Assets) and exposes public pages at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

### Production (Gunicorn + eventlet)
A Dockerfile is provided. Build and run the container after supplying a `.env` file (or Docker secrets):
```bash
docker build -t fotos-baby .
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 fotos-baby
```
Gunicorn serves the Flask application using the `eventlet` worker to support concurrent uploads in the admin area.

## 🧪 Testing
Preliminary pytest stubs live in `test/`. Extend them with real assertions and run:
```bash
pytest
```
Pytest will automatically discover files in the `test/` package.

## 🛠️ Useful Maintenance Tasks
- **Regenerate portfolio galleries**: Every restart calls `Gallery.clear_temlates()` to rebuild `gallery.html` fragments for each portfolio category. Delete the generated files under `static/media/<category>/gallery.html` if you want to force regeneration manually.
- **Bulk client uploads**: The admin interface stores original files plus optimized `small/` and `blur/` WebP variants and corrects EXIF orientation in background threads.
- **Client downloads**: Use `/client-gallery/<username>?action=download` to produce ZIP archives with all original images for a project.

Happy shooting and smooth deployments! 📷
